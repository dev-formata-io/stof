# Stof Examples
A collection of real examples for you to play around with. Stof packages (directories with a pkg.stof file) can be ran with either `stof run PATH` or `stof test PATH` (using the CLI) depending on if you want #[main] functions ran or #[test] functions.

## Project Stof
Take a look at the "project.stof" file as another example. This repository has all of its configurations kept in that file (Cargo.toml, GitHub workflows (yaml), etc.), generated with the `stof run project.stof` command.
