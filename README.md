### A declarative runtime & data format for modern workflows

Stof is a unified data format that works seamlessly **with** other formats to bridge the gap between static data and programmable documents. It is a lightweight, embeddable, and portable data logic format & platform for AI, infra-as-code, and config-heavy workflows. It's built to support:

- Data-Mesh, Integration, & Orchestration **glue-layer**
- Universal LLM & AI workflows, tools, & **intersystem data**
- Smart configs with logic, types, units, schemas, & **self-validation**
- Asynchronous **validation & transformation**

> Think of Stof as a foundation for building robust and declarative data flows, config systems, or backend models.

## Core Stof principle: Everything as Data
Using data in whatever form it is defined should not be difficult. Stof is the glue-layer & interface for working with any type of data as a singular unified, portable, and embeddable document.

Stof accomplishes this by treating every piece of data as a component in a general graph (document) of containers. Whether it's functions, fields, PDFs, binaries, or anything else, Stof organizes it neatly and provides an interface for it.

The Stof runtime is a thin, embeddable runtime that allows a Stof document to manipulate itself through calling the functions it contains. Functions are just pieces of data like a field, so they can even operate on themselves.

Libraries are the only way a Stof function can operate outside of the document (Ex. HTTP, filesystem, etc.), which are not saved with the document and are controlled by the host system. This sandboxed behavior is advantageous for sending logic + data over networks or in any untrusted environments.

## When to use Stof?
Modern software (especially AI/ML, infra, cloud, CI/CD, and workflows) increasingly relies on structured data that needs to be:
- Human-readable
- Machine-validatable
- Extendable with logic
- Executable safely
- Translatable between formats
- Transported between systems
- Versioned and inspectable

But the tools we have for this are *primitive and fragmented*:
- JSON/YAML/TOML carry structure, but rely on other tools for behavior, types, units, schemas, or validations.
- External tools create complexity between systems and often require additional configuration & maintenence.
- Configs drift and break across environments.
- Runtime logic is scattered across codebases, devops scripts, and data definitions.

> Stof unifies **structure + validation + behavior** into one **coherent, inspectable, portable artifact**.

*Note: if you're doing simple config loading or small and static data modeling, learning Stof might feel like overkill. You can replicate most of what Stof does using JSON + code + libraries; it just takes more effort and lacks formality, organization, single-file simplicity, unification, etc. (also a big pain for cross-boundary systems, like APIs, teams, and services).*

## Example/Tour

``` rust
/*
 * True data interop!
 * Import/export any format - our goal is to work seamlessly WITH other formats.
 * Organize data, APIs, configs, connectors, pipelines, AI, etc. with objects & paths, as a graph.
 */
import "old_crusty_config.toml" as OldCrusty; // Creates a new root object named "OldCrusty"
import "norse.png" as self.NorseImage;        // Creates a child object with path "root.NorseImage"


/*
 * Define objects and fields in a JSON-like way.
 */

    str "just stof": "it's all Stof, so use types, etc."
}

field: 42              // Optionally end field declarations with a comma or semi-colon
str typed: "types!"    // Field types for consistency, readability, and reliability
const bool cool: true; // Constant fields for immutable data (with or without type)

MiB unit-types: OldCrusty.server.RAM; // Unit types for conversions on casts, operations, etc.
cm height: 6ft + 1in;                 // Expressions and a full runtime always available


/*
 * Functions & logic as data. Manipulate this document from within.
 *
 * - Sandboxed (host defines system access, if any)
 * - Portable (send and execute over a network)
 * - Simple (familiar, approachable, and intuative, without looking like a blob of JSON)
 */
fn hello_world() -> str {
    "hello, world"
}


/*
 * Use objects to organize every type of data, including logic & APIs.
 * Keyword "self" always refers to the current object.
 * Keyword "super" always refers to the parent object (if any).
 * Navigate the graph of data via dot separated paths (both down and up, including other roots).
 * Use "?" in front of function calls to return null if the function doesn't exist.
 */

    import "api"; // default ".stof" extension if not provided

/*
 * Attributes for metadata & control (both fields & functions).
 *
 * - Used for main, test, and async functions
 * - Reference objects, functions, and data (validation, access control, schemas, etc.)
 * - Always available programmatically for metadata access

/*
 * Foundational async behavior for modern networking and concurrency.
 * No threads by default, but host system can implement async as single or multi-threaded.
 *
 * Note: "async fn" just adds #[async] as a function attribute.
 *
 * - HTTP requests & APIs
 * - Database connections
 * - Event driven systems
 * - Declarative UI + logic

/**
 * Stof CLI uses #[main] attributes by default to tell which functions to run with `stof run`.

 * Run with CLI via `stof run readme.stof` - you'll see `Hello, Stof!` printed to your console.
 * Run with `stof -d run readme.stof` - you'll now see YAML output in addition.
 *
 * Logging (log_debug, log_trace, log_info, log_warn, log_error) built in:
 * - `stof run readme.stof` - only log_warn & log_error
 * - `stof -d run readme.stof` - log_info in addition to warn & error
 * - `stof -dd run readme.stof` - all logs available
 * - uses "log" Rust crate for flexibility
